# hello-world

Hello fellow inhabitants!

My name is Monique Bowler. I am a fun-loving, outdoorsy, thrill seeking human from Missouri. Four wheeelers and dirt bikes are one of my passionate hobbies as well as photography. I am a Marketing Specialist currently seeking employment. I was recently fired from my previous marketing position. If you have questions about me ask them in the comments. I would love to answer them.
